# how to use this repository

`git clone` into a location such that `../determined` is the root of `determined-ai/determined`.

Install `tmuxinator` (`brew install tmuxinator` on macOS) then run `./rundet` (may need to `chmod +x ./rundet`).

Set `set -g mouse on` in your `~/.tmux.conf` for more pleasant experience since it allows your to click to change windows.
